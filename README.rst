git-games
=========

*git-games* is a collection of (mostly classical paper) games which can be played by using GIT for educational purposes. It might be more fun to play these games with paper an pencil, but less fun to learn GIT or test GIT commands without playing these games! :)


How to play
-----------

Playing involves roughly the following steps:

- fork this repository (or clone and push to your own GIT server)
- add other player(s) as collaborators to the fork (or allow pushing to your)
- clone the fork to your local machine
- play the game by editing files, committing and pushing
- clean the board to original state
- add the winner to the wall of fame in table below
- create a pull request (adds wall of fame and all moves)

**Detailed instructions can be found in the README.rst for each game.**
